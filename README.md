Voice Assistant with Python
A basic voice assistant built using Python that demonstrates speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. This project utilizes the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries to create an interactive assistant that listens to user commands and responds with a synthesized voice.

Features
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text using Google's speech recognition service.
Text-to-Speech: Provides spoken responses with a configurable voice using pyttsx3.
Real-time Preview: Displays recognized spoken words in the terminal for immediate feedback.
Custom Voice Settings: Configurable voice properties including a deeper tone and support for Indian accent (if available).
Installation
To get started with the voice assistant, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
cd voice-assistant
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python voice_assistant.py
The assistant will greet you and listen for commands. Speak your commands and see the responses in the terminal.

Customization
Voice Properties: Modify the set_voice_properties function to adjust the voice rate, volume, and accent as needed.
Commands: Update the main function to handle additional commands and responses according to your needs.
Dependencies
speech_recognition: For converting speech to text.
pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.
pyaudio: For microphone access.
